Code: Fig. S8. Hierarchical Clustering Highlights Groups of Drugs with Similar Target Profiles. Heatmap showing 77 S&W drugs from the E918 dataset and their respective targets (colored cells). Clustering performed using Euclidean distance and single linkage.

Code: Fig. S9. Pathway Enrichment. Heatmap showing successful (S&W) drugs in the E918 dataset and their respective Reactome pathways in which their targets are enriched. Hierarchical clustering (Euclidean, single linkage) highlights different groups of drugs with similar pathway profiles. We highlight the pathways for three drug clusters, emphasizing the proteins targeted in one exemplary pathway for each cluster.
